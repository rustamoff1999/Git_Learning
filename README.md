# Git, GitHub and Version Control Deep Learning(Command Line)
At the moment I study iOS Development with Udemy Course "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu and one of the Topics is Git, GitHub and Version Control. I used Command Line Interface during learning it and you can see another repository in my profile where I did almost same things but using the GitHub Interface.
